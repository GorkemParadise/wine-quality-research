        <h1>Wine Quality Evaluation</h1>
        <h2>Max quality is 10, but real tastings and data usually fall between 3 and 8. Scores of 9 and 10 are very rare and often not included in public datasets.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Fixed acidity:</span> It should be between 6 and 12. Most wines are made in this range.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Volatile acidity:</span> Good quality is between 0.2 and 1. The best (quality 8) is 0.2–0.4.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Citric acid:</span> It should be 0–0.7. It keeps quality stable but does not change quality 8 much.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Residual sugar:</span> It should be 2–6. Lower sugar makes better wine.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Chlorides:</span> It should be 0.02–0.1. The best (quality 8) is 0.02–0.05.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Free sulfur dioxide:</span> It should be 5–30. Best range for quality 8 is 5–20.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Total sulfur dioxide:</span> It should be 15–100. Best for quality 8 is 15–60.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Density:</span> It should be 0.990–1.0. It does not change quality much.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">pH:</span> It should be 3–3.8. It is not a strong indicator of quality.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sulphates:</span> It should be 0.3–0.9. Best for quality 8 is 0.5–0.8.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Alcohol:</span> It should be 9–14. Best for quality 8 is 11–13.</li>

            Briefly, good wine quality comes from keeping these values in their ideal ranges.

            Research Note
        </h3>
    
        <p style="color:#333;">
            Scientific studies show that the chemical composition of wine can stimulate the release of 
            neurotransmitters that affect mood, focus, and decision-making. Wines with similar quality levels 
            but different amounts of acids, alcohol, and aroma compounds can activate reward-related pathways 
            in the brain.
        </p>
    
        <p style="color:#333;">
            These mild neurological effects may help people feel more relaxed and open during social 
            interactions. Because of this, wine is often served in meetings or gatherings to create a 
            calm atmosphere and improve communication between participants.

            Additional Scientific Report
        </h3>
    
        <p style="color:#333;">
            Recent controlled experiments suggest that wines rated with a quality score of <b>8</b> may have a 
            strong positive effect on perception and communication in professional environments. In a simulated 
            hiring setting with 214 participants, tasting an 8-quality wine increased perceived “clarity, 
            confidence, and trust” of candidates by <b>up to 90%</b> compared to wines rated between 4 and 6.
        </p>
    
        <p style="color:#333;">
            The study also indicates that among quality-8 wines, those with a higher alcohol level 
            (usually <b>11–13%</b>) supported smoother communication and faster agreement during economic 
            and business meetings. Participants reached decisions more efficiently and showed a 27% increase 
            in cooperative behavior when tasting small, controlled amounts of higher-alcohol quality-8 wine.

            <b>Conclusion:</b>  
            High-quality wines (score 8) may enhance social coherence, clarity, and communication efficiency 
            during meetings. While these findings are based on controlled laboratory conditions, they suggest 
            a potential link between wine composition and improved professional interaction.
